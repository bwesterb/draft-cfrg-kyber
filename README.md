# Kyber

This is a draft describes [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/index.shtml),
NIST's pick for post-quantum key agreement.

Very much work-in-progress at the moment!

**NOTE** This draft is not stable and does not (yet) match the final
NIST standard expected in 2024. Currently it matches Kyber as submitted
to round 3 of the NIST PQC process.
