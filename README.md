# Kyber Post-Quantum KEM

This is the working area for the individual Internet-Draft, "Kyber Post-Quantum KEM".
It described [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/index.shtml),
NIST's pick for post-quantum key agreement.

It also contains "machine-readable" specification of Kyber in Python.

Very much [work-in-progress](https://github.com/bwesterb/draft-schwabe-cfrg-kyber/issues) at the moment!

**NOTE** This draft is not stable and does not (yet) match the final
NIST standard expected in 2024. Currently it matches Kyber as submitted
to round 3 of the NIST PQC process.
